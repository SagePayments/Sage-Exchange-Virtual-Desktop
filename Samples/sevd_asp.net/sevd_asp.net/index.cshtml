    <title>pg 1 - PEVD Sample</title>
</head>

<!--

    DESCRIPTION:
        This is a sample integration to the Paya Exchange Virtual Desktop (PEVD).
        The PEVD is a Paya-hosted interface for credit card and ACH payments. By
        collecting credit card information on our servers, your own site avoids
        the PCI compliance requirements associated with "touching" credit card
        data.

    TECHNICAL:
        .NET version 4.5
        Razor version 3

    SUPPORT:
        We've done our best to add comments throughout these files. That said, it is
        not possible to exhaustively anticipate and address every potential scenario
        that may arise! Please email sdksupport@sage.com for assistance integrating to
        the PEVD, or any other questions involving third-party integrations to the
        Sage Payment Solutions gateway. Any code snippets, logs, responses, etc.
        that you can provide make troubleshooting much easier, and are appreciated.

    TERMS OF USE:
        This sample was created for demonstrative purposes only. Please do not provide
        these files, their content, PEVD documentation, or any other relevant material
        to any parties not directly involved with your integration.
